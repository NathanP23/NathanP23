# 👋 Hi, I’m Nathan

🎓 I'm a Data Science student at **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem** and a Data Analyst at the **Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)**.

🔬 I specialize in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and the application of **statistical modeling** to real-world data — especially under constraints of scale, latency, and deployment.

🧠 My recent focus is on **deep neural network architectures** and **practical PyTorch implementations**, based on my work in the advanced course [**Introduction to Deep Learning (67822)**](https://github.com/NathanP23/Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-67822), where I’ve:
- Built and trained **convolutional autoencoders (CAEs)**
- Explored **transfer learning** from pretrained encoders to new classifiers
- Studied and implemented **RNNs, CNNs, GANs, AEs, diffusion models, and attention mechanisms**
- Applied **loss landscape analysis**, **optimization techniques**, and **theoretical understanding** of the functional space neural networks span

📚 Other key repositories include:
- [Regression and Statistical Models (52571)](https://github.com/NathanP23/Regression-and-Statistical-Models-52571)
- [Statistical Learning and Data Analysis (52525)](https://github.com/NathanP23/Statistical-Learning-and-Data-Analysis-52525)
- [Big Data Mining (52002)](https://github.com/NathanP23/Big-Data-Mining-52002)

⚙️ Tools & Tech:
- **Python**, **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**
- **Docker**, **FastAPI**, **Redis**, **SQL**, **Bash**
- **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, **JupyterLab**

🤝 I'm open to collaboration on:
- Deep learning projects using PyTorch or Transformers
- Research or experiments in model optimization, data efficiency, or architectural innovation
- Applied ML pipelines and distributed systems for large-scale analytics

🎸 Fun fact: I love heavy metal and play guitar in my free time.
